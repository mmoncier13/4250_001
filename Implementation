Requirements – Recursive
Program must ask the user to input two integers.
Program must validate the user’s input are both valid integers.
Program must take the two integers and add them together.
Program must call a recursive function to add the integers together until a single digit integer is achieved.
Program displays the final single digit integer once computation is achieved.

Recursive Function
If the input is a single integer, the function should return the single integer.
If not, the input should be separated into the first half and last digit.
The last digit must be added to the first half of the integer.
Process loops through until a single digit integer is achieved.

Assumptions
Program will only accept non-negative whole integers.
